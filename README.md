# Static-Formulas


## Statics Formulas Documentation: Core Concepts

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the essential formulas used in static analysis, a fundamental branch of statistics. It focuses on measures of central tendency, and dispersion, and explores methods to identify the most frequent value (mode) within a data set.

### Understanding Data Distribution:

* **Central Tendency:**

* Refers to  the "centre" or average value of a data set.
  
* **Dispersion:**

*   Indicates how spread out the data points are from the central tendency.

### Key Formulas:

1. **Relative Frequency:**

   - **Formula:** Relative Frequency = Frequency / Total Frequency
   - **Explanation:** Calculates the proportion of a specific value (frequency) compared to the total number of observations (total frequency) in the data set. It expresses frequency as a percentage or decimal value between 0 and 1.

2. **Mean:**

   - **Formula:** Mean = Sum of Numbers / Total Numeric Count
   - **Explanation:** Represents the average of all numerical values in the data set. It provides a single value that summarizes the central tendency.

3. **Median:**

   **Formula:**
     - Even number of observations: Median = (N + 1) / 2 (where N is the total number of observations)
     - Odd number of observations: Median = N / 2
     **Explanation:**
   -  The median is the "middle" value when the data is arranged in ascending or descending order. It's less sensitive to outliers compared to the         mean.

4. **Mode:**

    **Explanation:**
   -  The mode is the most frequent value (or values) within a data set. It identifies the data point that appears most often.

5. **Range:**

    **Formula:**
   Range = Largest Value - Smallest Value
    **Explanation:**
   - The range represents the difference between the highest and lowest values in the data set. It's a simple measure of dispersion but can be sensitive to       
     outliers.

7. **Standard Deviation (STD):**

   - **Formula:**
   - STD (σ) = √(Σ(x - mean)^2 / N)
     - Σ (sigma) represents the summation symbol
     - x represents each data point
     - N represents the total number of observations
       
    **Explanation:**
   -  Standard deviation (STD) measures how spread out the data is from the mean. A higher STD indicates a wider spread of data points.

8. **Variance:**

   - **Formula:**
      Variance = STD^2
     
     **Explanation:**
   - Variance is the square of the standard deviation. It represents the average squared deviation of each data point from the mean.

9. **Z-Score:**

   - **Formula:**
     - Z-Score = (x - mean) / σ
     - σ (sigma) represents the standard deviation
   - **Explanation:** The Z-score indicates how many standard deviations a specific data point (x) is away from the mean. It allows for the comparison of data points 
      from different data sets with varying scales.

**By understanding and applying these formulas, you can effectively analyze and interpret data sets, gaining valuable insights into their central tendencies, dispersion patterns, and most frequent values.**
